# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the project
The purpose of this project was to get an idea of how many of the current employees will be retiring soon and how prepared the company is to fill those positions. The manager wants to see how much of a threat the "Silver Tsunami" actually is, so I created tables with data and ran queries to find out how many employees were eligible for retirement and how many employees were eligible for the mentorship program.

## Results

1. There is a very high number of senior employees eligible for retirement which could pose as an issue because that kind of training cannot be done in a short period of time.
2. Only 2 managers are retiring which is a positive meaning they wont have to replace as many leadership positions.
3. Only 1549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program
4. Roughly 30% (90,398/300,024) of the employees are eligible for retirement.


## Summary
There will need to 90,398 roles filled as the "Silver Tsunami" takes its impact.
There are not nearly enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the new employees. Pewlett Hackard will have to come up with a very extensice new training program.

The table above shows us that Departments 'd004' and 'd005' have the highest number of retiring employees - those departments are Production and Development.Those positions also have the highest number of Senior employees.
